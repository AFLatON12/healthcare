# Distributed Healthcare Management System – Phase 1

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the **Distributed Information Systems (CSE474)** course at Alalamein University. The aim is to build a **Distributed Healthcare Management System** using microservices architecture, Docker, and modern web technologies.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Development Environment & Microservices Setup

### 🎯 Objective

The goal of Phase 1 was to prepare the development environment and set up the core microservices architecture.

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed

1. **Installed Required Tools**
   - Node.js
   - Laravel
   - MongoDB Atlas / MySQL
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes

2. **Defined Microservices Structure**
   - **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication using JWT and OAuth.
   - **Healthcare Service Management**: Manages appointments, services, and related data.
   - **Transaction Service**: Manages appointments booking, billing, and payment logic.

3. **Initialized Projects**
   - **Backend**: Set up using Laravel or Node.js + Express.js.
   - **Frontend**: Initialized using React.js / Vue.js / Angular (to be expanded in later phases).

4. **Docker Containerization**
   - Created `Dockerfile` for each microservice.
   - Configured `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate multi-container setup.

5. **Tested Docker Containers**
   - Verified individual containers run correctly.
   - Ensured basic communication between services.
